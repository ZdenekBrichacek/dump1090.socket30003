# dump1090.socket30003

socket30003.pl
* Collects dump1090 flight positions (ADB-S format) using socket 30003 and save them in csv format.

heatmap.pl
* Reads the flight positions from files in csv format and creates points for a heatmap.
* The heatmap shows where planes come very often. It makes common routes visable.
* Output in csv format and locations in javascript code.

rangeview.pl
* Reads the flight positions from files in csv format and creates a range/altitude view map. 
* The range/altitude view shows the maximum range of your antenna for every altitude zone.
* KML output support.

The output heatmapdata.csv and rangeview.kml can be displayed in a modified variant 
of dump1090-mutability: https://github.com/tedsluis/dump1090

# Help page socket30003.pl
````
This socket30003.pl script can retrieve flight data (lat, lon and alt) from
a dump1090 host using port 30003 and calcutates the distance and angle
between the antenna and the plane. It will store these values in an 
output file in csv format (seperated by commas).

This script can run several times simultaneously on one host retrieving
data from multiple dump1090 instances on different hosts. Each instance 
can use the same directories, but they all have their own data, log and 
pid files. And every day the script will create a new data and log file.

A data files contain column headers (with the names of the columns). 
Columns headers like 'altitude' and 'distance' also contain their unit
between parentheses, for example '3520(feet)' or '12,3(kilometer)'. This
makes it more easy to parse the columns when using this data in other
scripts. Every time the script is (re)started a header wiil be written 
in to the data file. This way it is possible to switch a unit, for 
example from 'meter' to 'kilometer', and other scripts will still be able
to determine the correct unit type.

By default the position data, a log file and a pid file are written 
in the /tmp directory in this format:
  dump1090-<hostname/ip_address>-<YYMMDD>.txt
  dump1090-<hostname/ip_address>-<YYMMDD>.log
  dump1090-<hostname/ip_address>.pid

The script can be lauched as a background process. It can be stopped by
using the -stop parameter or by removing the pid file. When it not 
running as a background process, it can also be stopped by pressing 
CTRL-C. The script will write the current data and log entries to the 
filesystem before exiting...

	                                Default altitude unit is meter.
	-nopositions                    Does not display the number of position when running.

	-help                           This help page.

Notes: 
- To launch it as a background process, add '&' or run it from crontab:
  0 * * * * <path>/socket30003.pl
  (This command checks if it ran every hour and relauch it if nessesary.)
- The default values can be changed within the script (in the most upper section).
- When launched from the commandline it will display the number of positions.

Examples:
	socket30003.pl 
	socket30003.pl -peer 192.168.1.10 -nopositions -distanceunit nauticalmile -altitudeunit feet &
	socket30003.pl -log /var/log -data /home/pi -pid /var/run -restart 
	socket30003.pl -peer 192.168.1.10 -stop

Pay attention: when stopping an instance: Don't forget to specify correct the peer host.

# Help page heatmap.pl
````
This heatmap.pl script creates heatmap data 
which can be displated in a modified variant of dump1090-mutobility.

It creates two output files:
1) One file with locations in java script code, which can be added
   to the script.js manualy.
2) One file with location data in csv format, which can be imported
   from the dump1090 GUI.

Please read this post for more info:
http://discussions.flightaware.com/post180185.html#p180185

This script uses the output file(s) of the 'socket30003.pl'
script, which are by default stored in /tmp in this format:
dump1090-<hostname/ip_address>-YYMMDD.txt

The script will automaticly use the correct units (feet, meter, 
kilometer, mile, natical mile) for 'altitude' and 'distance' when 
the input files contain column headers with the unit type between 
parentheses. When the input files doesn't contain column headers 
(as produced by older versions of 'socket30003.pl' script)
you can specify the units. Otherwise this script will use the 
default units.

This script will create a heatmap of a square area around your 
antenna. You can change the default range by specifing the number
of degrees -/+ to your antenna locations. This area will be devided
in to small squares. The default heatmap has a resolution of 
1000 x 1000 squares. The script will read all the flight position 
data from the input file(s) and count the times they match with a 
square on the heatmap. 

The more positions match with a particular square on the heatmap, 
the more the 'weight' that heatmap position gets. We use only the 
squares with the most matches (most 'weight) 'to create the heatmap.
This is because the map in the browser gets to slow when you use 
too much positions in the heatmap. Of cource this also depends on 
the amount of memory of your system. You can change the default 
number of heatmap positions. You can also set the maximum of 
'weight' per heatmap position. 

Syntax: heatmap.pl

Optional parameters:
	-data <data directory>          The data files are stored
	                                 in /tmp by default.

	                                default filemask is 'dump*.txt'.
	-lon <lonitude>                 Location of your antenna.
	-lat <latitude>
	-maxpositions <max positions>   Default is 100000 positions.
	-maxweight <number>             Maximum position weight on 
	                                the heatmap. The default is 1000.
	-resolution <number>            Number of horizontal and vertical
	                                positions in output heatmap file.
	                                Default is 1000, which 
	                                means 1000x1000 positions.
	-degrees <number>               To determine boundaries of 
	                                area around the antenna.
	                                (lat-degree <--> lat+degree) x
	                                (lon-degree <--> lon+degree)
	                                De default is 5 degree.

This rangeview.pl script creates location data 
for a range/altitude view which can be displated in a modified 
fork of dump1090-mutobility.

The script creates two output files:
rangeview.csv) A file with location data in csv format can be 
   imported in to tools like http://www.gpsvisualizer.com. 
rangeview.kml) A file with location data in kml format, which
   can be imported into a modified dum1090-mutability.

Please read this post for more info:
http://discussions.flightaware.com/post180185.html#p180185

This script uses the output file(s) of the 'socket30003.pl'
script, which are by default stored in /tmp in this format:
dump1090-<hostname/ip_address>-YYMMDD.txt

It will read the files one by one and it will automaticly use 
the correct units (feet, meter, mile, nautical mile of kilometer)
for 'altitude' and 'distance' when the input files contain 
column headers with the unit type between parentheses. When 
the input files doesn't contain column headers (as produced 
by older versions of 'socket30003.pl' script) you can specify 
the units. Otherwise this script will use the default units.

The flight position data is sorted in to altitude zones. For 
each zone and for each direction the most remote location is 
saved. The most remote locations per altitude zone will be 
written to a file as a track. 


Syntax: rangeview.pl

Optional parameters:
